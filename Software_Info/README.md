# Software Information

Our robot dog operates on Raspberry Pi with the ROS system implemented inside. For code modifications and daily software maintenance, connection with a laptop or PC is necessary. The default connection method is direct connection mode, which the computer is connected to the robot dog via hotspot signal generated by the robot dog. Such connection method is considered as one of the fastest and most efficient. This Readme will demonstrate how to establish such connection alongside with some basic commands of the robot. 

# 

**Hardware Preparation**

A laptop or a PC that supports 5G frequency band si necessary. If the 5G frequency band is not supported, the hotspot launched by the Raspberry Pi may not be detacted and therefore causes possible failures in connections. 
If modifications of frequency band is necessary, please see  document named [Frequency Band Modification](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GD__5xuZk4O3mtA4BLRECDd8F9Z3My8E) provided by Hiwonder. 


**VNC Viewer Installation**

VNC Viewer is a graphic remote control software that is compatible with the robot dog. With VNC, we can directly access the Raspberry Pi on personal computer through the hotspot generated by the Puppy Pi. 

For Windows installation of the VNC Viewer, please download the document [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11sKy2Hfr73Ogibdv9UpjCGfhcvdci4lk/view).

Follow the prompt of the VNC Viewer Setup, proceed all steps with default settings. When the prompt below is shown, it marks a successful installation and an icon of VNC viewer should be present.

**Boot Up Puppy Pi**

Flip the switch on the robot dog into the on position.  The LED1 on the extension board of Raspberry Pi will light up and LED2 will flash continuously. When the robot dog finishes initialization, the buzzer will beep once, and the robot dog will return to initial posture signaling that the robot is ready for connection.  

The default network mode for the robot is AP Direct Connection. After initialization, the Raspberry Pi should launch a Wifi hotspot with the naming format of “HW-xxxxxxxx” as shown in the screenshot below:

After the installation of VNC Viewer, we can add the robot to the viewer by entering the default IP address of the Raspberry Pi: 192.168.149.1.

Then the VNC Viewer will prompt for authentication information, the Username is “pi” and the password is “raspberry”.

**OAK-D**

OAK-D is the ultimate camera for robotic vision developed by [Luxonis](https://www.luxonis.com). It perceives the world like a human by combining stereo depth camera and high-resolution color camera with an on-device Neural Network inferencing and Computer Vision capabilities. It uses USB-C for both power and USB3 connectivity.
