# Problems
1. Object avoidance logic does not work well with line following, conflicts could arise
2. Line following does terrible on black lines
3. Apriltag recognition does not have any effect on movement now

# Where To Look Into 
Line 89, tagAnalysis function, recognizes a tag, print it. Could add more to that function.
Line 477, image_callback function, controls the workflow of image processing.
Line 314, move function, controls how the dog moves. The logic of the function needs an overhaul.
