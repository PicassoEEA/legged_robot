## Autonomous Legged Robot
This repository is for the senior design class team 2. PuppyPi, our autonomous-legged robot is an AI guide dog, providing visually-impaired users with timely information about obstacle positions for safer navigation. The robot's first function is to reach a pre-determined destination using an audio-based user interface. It will have the ability to understand the building's map based on lines on the floor and gather information about the building by scanning QR codes placed on the floor. Decoding each QR code provides information about the location, helping the robot dog decide where to go and guiding the user to the intended destination.
